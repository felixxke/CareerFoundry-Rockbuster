# CareerFoundry-Rockbuster

Repository of SQL scripts for my Rockbuster project completed through CareerFoundry's Data Analytics program.

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores all around the world. Facing stiff competition from other streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. We are tasked by Rockbuster Stealth to help with the launch strategy for the new online video rental service.

We are using an open-source data set from Rockbuster Stealth LLC for this project.
